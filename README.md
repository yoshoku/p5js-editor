## Motivation

While there are many excellent online editors for p5.js,
such as the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/),
they require users to create accounts to save their sketches.
This can be a burden for students in programming classes or short workshops.
Additionally, beginners do not need advanced features for introductory lessons.
That is why I created this simple p5.js online editor that focuses on ease of use
without requiring account registration.
